#Interaction and Physics

## Topics

1. How to use custom version of the [WebXR emulator](https://github.com/csc495-vr-f2022/WebXR-emulator-extension)
2. Including an update() function in the main loop
3. Reading controller input using polling
4. Viewing the debug console on the Quest
5. Grabbing objects with the controllers
6. Using a physics engine

## Participation Exercise

Add the code for grabbing objects with your left controller.  This will involve adding a `leftGrabbedObject` and then copying and pasting the code from the right hand.  You can submit your `index.ts` file on Canvas, or alternatively you can submit a screenshot of you grabbing an object with the left controller.
